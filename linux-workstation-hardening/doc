Why are you doing this?
I am doing this to understand at least in some scope processes running under the hood.

Will it increase safety?
I don't know

1. Manual diagnostics

a) ps (ps -eo pid,euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label) <- interesting line)


* /sbin/init (systemd) - may start another processes, which we can check later.

* [kthreadd] - this is ok, it spawns threads

* [ksoftirqd] - this is ok, it does something with softirqs.

* [kworker/0:0H] - it's a kthread which does some delayed works
			[kworker/%u:??????????] <- what is this??????
			First %u means CPU number. Rest - idk.

* [rcu_sched] - ??? - something with rcu					TODO TODO
* [rcu_bh] - ??? - something with rcu						TODO TODO
* [migration/0] - related to (linux/kernel/stop_machine.c)
* [lru-add-drain] - something with memory (mm/swap.c)
* [watchdog/0] - watchdog (kernel/watchdog.c)
* [cpuhp/0] - something with teardown/setup callbacks on the plugged cpu (kernel/cpu.c)
* [kdevtmpfs] - tmp filesystem
* [netns] - used to cleanup on network namespace (net/core/net_namespace.c)
* [khungtaskd] - used to print info about hanging uninterruptible tasks (kernel/hung_task.c)
* [oom_reaper] - used somehow for a 'out of memory reaper' (mm/oom_kill.c)
* [writeback] - ???? (mm/backing-dev.c)						TODO TODO
* [kcompactd] - kernel daemon for some memory 'compact' (mm/compaction.c)	TODO TODO
* [ksmd] - KSM daemon (look documentation)
* [khugepaged]  - somehow pages are not 4k, but i.e. 1GB - daemon.
* [crypto] - crypto workqueue
* [kintegrityd] - workqueue, used to call verify I/O something function for bio? block i/o.
* [bioset] - workqueue, something with bio_alloc_rescue
* [kblockd] - used for unplugging and affects IO latency/throughput
* [ata_sff] - drivers/ata/libata-sff.c, workqueue, used for dma transfer work, dma finish work. Multiple usage over libata, ata driver etc.
* [md] - drivers/md/md.c, workqueue, used internally for md driver (extremal usage, not simple task to learn)...
	 something with RAID's, LVM
* [edac_poller] - part of drivers/edac/, edac is used for error detection and correction in memory controllers <--- intersting
* [devfreq_wq] -  * devfreq: Generic Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) Framework for Non-CPU Devices workqueue
* [watchdogd] - watchdog thread
* [kswapd0] - mm/vmscan.c, ackground pageout daemon
* [ecryptfs-kthrea] - fs/ecryptfs/kthread.c
* [kthrotld] - blk-throttle.c
* [acpi_thermal_pm] - drivers/acpi/thermal.c
* [scsi_eh_0] -
* [] -


b) /sbin/init (systemd)

1. iptables

2. tomoyo and others
